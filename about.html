        My name is Eduardo, I am currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at the Federal Institute of
        Education,
        Science and Technology of São Paulo, Campus São Carlos. I'm 21 years old, and I've been involved in programming
        and data
        for 2 years.

        As someone who is passionate about data analysis and data in general, I am also very drawn to the world of
        business intelligence. Data analysis is a fundamental part of business intelligence, as it is from there that we
        can
        extract valuable insights to help in decision making. Combining my skills in data analysis and PL/SQL
        development, I can
        help turn raw data into valuable information that can help companies better understand their business, identify
        growth
        opportunities, and make more strategic and informed decisions. For me, it is very rewarding to be able to work
        in the
        data field because I feel like I am helping to make a difference in business and ultimately in people's lives.
        It is an
        area that motivates me a lot and I hope to continue learning and developing my skills to become increasingly
        effective
        in helping companies use their data more intelligently.
